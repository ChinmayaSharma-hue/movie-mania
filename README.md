# Movie-Mania
A website where one can browse movies, look up details of a movie along with the reviews which have been scored using a sentiment analysis model. The frontend components have been designed using React and the backend has beend developed using Django. The model weights have been downloaded and the inference for the reviews are drawn using the downloaded weights in the backend. In order to view all the movies and their details, api calls are made to the movie database api service, TMDB. <br>
The website has been [deployed](https://reactdjangomoviedatabaseapp.herokuapp.com/).
